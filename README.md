# Arduino Uno R3 Board Project

## Overview
This project involves creating an Arduino Uno R3 board using an ATmega328p microcontroller, various electronic components, and Proteus software for schematic and PCB design. The board includes essential features such as voltage regulators, a reset button, a crystal oscillator, and built-in LEDs.

## Methodology

### Selection of Hardware Components
The project begins with selecting and acquiring the necessary hardware components, including:
- ATmega328p microcontroller
- Capacitors (ceramic and polar)
- Voltage regulators (7805 and LM317)
- Resistors
- Push button
- LEDs
- Crystal oscillator
- Female header pins
- DIP socket
- Connecting wires

### Working of Each Component
- **ATmega328p:** Acts as the central processing unit, executing program code and controlling inputs and outputs.
- **Voltage Regulators:** Convert input voltage to stable 5V and 3.3V supply voltages, ensuring reliable power for the microcontroller and other components.
- **Capacitors:** Stabilize voltage and filter out noise in power supplies and circuit components.
- **Resistors:** Limit current and set component values, also used for pull-up and pull-down of input pins.
- **LEDs:** Provide indication and feedback to users.
- **Crystal Oscillator:** Provides a steady clock signal for precise timing.
- **Push Button:** Accesses the microcontroller's reset capability, restarting the program code.

### Circuit Design
The schematic in Proteus depicts connections between electronic components, illustrating the circuit's structure. Components include the microcontroller, crystal oscillator, voltage regulators, resistors, capacitors, push button, and LEDs. Female headers facilitate connections to the microcontroller's digital and analog pins.

### Working and Testing
- **LED Blinking:** A simple program blinks the built-in LED connected to the microcontroller's digital pin 13.
- **5V Regulator Circuit:** Utilizes the 7805 voltage regulator to provide a constant 5 volts DC output, with capacitors for stability and a resistor for current limitation.
- **3.3V Regulator Circuit:** Utilizes the LM317 voltage regulator for an adjustable 3.3V output, with resistors and capacitors for stability and noise reduction.

### PCB Layout Design
After successful simulation of the schematic, the PCB layout is designed in Proteus. Components are arranged, connections are routed, and auto-routing and manual routing tools are used. The layout includes edge sketches, silk layers, copper layers, and traces to ensure proper functionality and prevent short circuits.

### Breadboard Implementation
The circuit is implemented on a breadboard following the schematic and software simulation. The ATmega328p is programmed using an Arduino UNO board and later converted into a PCB by soldering components onto a perf/Vero board.

This project demonstrates the process of designing and creating an Arduino Uno R3 board, including component selection, schematic design, PCB layout, and practical implementation. It highlights the importance of each component and their role in ensuring the functionality and reliability of the board.
